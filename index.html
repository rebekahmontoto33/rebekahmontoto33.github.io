          REBEKAH MONTOTO (22) a student at the University of Miami stumbles
          upon her grandfathers old typewriter. This is perfect! She quickly
          dusts it off and places it on a little wooden desk. She turns to
          a mosiac lamp covered in cobwebs and yanks hard on its chain,
          illuminating the entire room... Wow! This place could use a good
          cleaning.</p>
